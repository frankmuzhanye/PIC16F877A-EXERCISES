# PIC16F877A-PROJECTS

This is a Compilation of all the projects and simulation files that I did using the microcontroller, PIC16F877A, with the the use of software's, Proteus v8 and mikroC.

In each project folder there is 
- A Proteus simulation file
- MikroC code files

The code for the microcontroller was written in C language which can be found in the project folder.

You can load the .hex file (in the project folder) to the pic16f877a after opening the Proteus simulation file.
